          <p>
            My team grows with purpose, compassion, and drive. They’re talented individuals that bring their passion for great experiences and inspire those around them. Through a shared vision, we create compelling, human-centered experiences in a creative environment.
          </p>

          <h2>A successful design team has room for growth</h2>

          <p><small>Our users are everything</small><br />A deep understanding of the user generates empathy. Empathy generates a desire to make their world that much better.</p>
          <p><small>Share the vision</small><br />Set a foundation of solid design principles and content strategy to guide design decisions while staying connected to the broader experience vision.</p>
          <p>
            <small>Establishes design systems</small><br />
            Quality design systems include a balance of design and people processes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consistent visual design languages</li>
            <li>Interaction models based on our shared vision and design principles</li>
            <li>Qualitative and quantitative metrics for informed growth</li>
            <li>Communication strategies to keep everyone aligned</li>
          </ul>
          <p><small>Stop, collaborate, and listen</small><br />Work closely with our product and development partners so they are involved from discovery to delivery and beyond for shared ownership.</p>
          <p><small>Measure impact and iterate</small><br />Benchmark KPIs and continue to measure the impact of our work in support of our product partners’ goals.</p>

          <h2>Proudest Leadership Achievement</h2>
          <p>
            My proudest achievement as a design leader is when my team’s vocabulary is echoed back by partners and leaders in the organization when talking about our mission. It proves that my team and I are truly effective in providing a strong design foundation and culture. A close second is when I am able to promote from within my team and watch new design leadership flourish.
          </p>

          <h2>A successful leader is a servant leader</h2>
          <p><small>Servant leader</small><br />I am there to lift up my team and be their biggest fan. I help them elevate their personal brand within the organization by evangelizing their craft and showing how their work impacts the company.</p>
          <p><small>Building trust</small><br />I trust the team to be inclusive and make thoughtful design choices. Conversely, the team trusts that I provide guidance and a seat at the table.</p>
          <p><small>Creating a design culture</small><br />I foster open discussions about all aspects of design through continued learning and design critiques with the team or privately.</p>
          <p><small>Staying in the mix</small><br />I keep my ears open to what’s happening in and around the team and react appropriately.</p>
          <p><small>Sharing experiences</small><br />I mentor through shared experiences and heartfelt conversations. I invest in their career as well as them personally.</p>
          <p><small>Coaching</small><br />I encourage each person to explore what motivates them, where they want to take their career and invest in what truly interests them. Together, we align their individual goals to their answers and develop those abilities.</p>
          <p><small>Open communication</small><br />I stay up to date with consistent check-ins through regular team meetings and personal 1:1s where we discuss challenges, and priorities, as well as career and personal development.</p>
