          <h2>I’m a total design nerd.</h2>
          <p>
            I find great joy in building and mentoring teams of talented people. Having conversations, sharing ideas, helping others grow professionally, and inspiring creativity in a caring environment is my jam. Through bold leadership and true diversity, great work is bound to happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I understand and know how to communicate the value of a great user experience at all levels of the organization. This includes fewer support calls, less time training, reduced time on task, positive adoption rates, and more, which all affect the bottom line for the business. Working with my business and technology partners to create an effective product and experience strategy (and executing on that strategy!) is critical to the success of any organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a designer with over 20 years of experience, I love to ask questions, find out how people work, and their motivations (especially those in my team). My favorite accomplishments are usually invisible to most people – things that just make life easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m actively involved in design communities including <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-leadership-forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invision’s Design Leadership Forum</a>, <a href="https://leadingdesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading Design</a>, <a href="https://www.hiretechladies.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Ladies</a>, <a href="https://leaders.centercentre.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaders of Awesomeness</a>, and <a href="http://hexagonux.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexagon UX</a>.
